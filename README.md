## 🚀 About Me
I am a 3rd-year Bachelor of Technology student in Computer Science (Honors) at GLA University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Analytics. I thrive at the intersection of **Generative AI**, **RAG architectures**, and **Model Context Protocols (MCP)**. 

Beyond technical implementation, I excel in communication and presentation, bridging the gap between complex backend architectures and impactful user experiences. I am currently focused on building intelligent agents that solve real-world financial and professional challenges.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** **ProteinScope AI**, a comprehensive dashboard for protein analysis.
- ⚡ **Key Strength:** Expert in implementing **MCP** as a universal adapter for AI agents.
- 📍 **Location:** Mathura, Uttar Pradesh.
